# FIXME
# - [x] Do we actually need artifacts here?
#    -> We have to remember to clean up the storage though
# - [x] Why don't we just build and deploy locally?
#    -> So that we can rollback without having to rebuild
# - [x] Use standard npm ci and npm build
#Â - [ ] Make sure commit messages are correct
# - [ ] Make sure deploys to pages correctly
